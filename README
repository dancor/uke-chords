I took 16 chord types and found all 62 ways to make them with at least
1 open string and within the first 3 frets.  These are the chords
which will generally form barre chords the best.  E.g. since C7 is
0001, you can form D7 by adding 2 to everything to get 2223.  This
means you play fret 2 on the G-string, 2 on the C-string, 2 on the
E-string, and 3 on the A-string.  Use your index finger to cover all
the 2s then use your middle finger to add the 3 on the A-string.

Chord inversions are ignored in this list.  I.e. in the 0100 voicing
of A7 the lowest-pitch note is C# not A so this might more properly be
called A7-first-inversion (or A7/C#).
